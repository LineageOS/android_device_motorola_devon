Although, if I recall correctly, these files are shipped in all the three devices\u0027 stock firmwares, I haven\u0027t commonised this because they are not shipped on guamp, which also uses the sm6225-common tree (although it doesn\u0027t look like it is going to be shipped anytime soon?). Let me know if I should commonise this.",
